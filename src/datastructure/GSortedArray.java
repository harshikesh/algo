/*Suppose that you have a sorted array of integers(positive or negative).
You want to apply a function of the form f(x)=a*x^2+b*x+c
to each element x of the array such that the resulting array is still sorted.
Implement this in Java or C++.The input are the initial sorted array
 and the function parameters(a,b and c).*/
